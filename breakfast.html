  Growing up, I never knew how to cook. When I finally learned, the easiest thing for me to learn was eggs and sausage. So everytime I cooked breakfast for family I was responsible for the eggs and sausage. 
  <br>
  I usually eat this meal as a quick breakfast option. Today, I will be sharing these ingredients.
