         <p>     <center> <font size="5"> Hello, my name is Dasia Charkel James, a junior Information Systems major from Little Rock, Arkansas. In high school, I was involved in many activities including drill team, student council, and National Honorâ€™s Society. My senior year, I was captain of the drill team, president of the student body, and a scholarship recipient of Howard University. Freshman year, I was on the Quad Stroll Team and served as Miss Quad. My sophomore year, I was the co-director of the School of Business Student Council Women Empowerment Initiative, a member of National Council of Negro Women, Miss School of Business Runner-up, and a fellow of Young Africana Leadership Initiative. I now serve as Miss Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Incorporated, Alpha Chapter 2017-2018. I aspire to mentor the underserved young women in my community through my nonprofit titled Secure.    </font>
